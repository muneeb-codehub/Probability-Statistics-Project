# Probability and Statistics Project
### Statistical Analysis of Student Depression

## 📊 Project Overview
Statistical analysis and predictive modeling of student depression using R programming. This project explores the relationships between academic pressure, sleep duration, age, lifestyle habits, and mental health outcomes through comprehensive exploratory data analysis and regression modeling.

- **Shahem Riaz** - BCS-4B (22F-3883)

**Instructor:** Nasir Abbas

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze factors contributing to depression among students
- Build predictive models using logistic and linear regression
- Identify high-risk student groups
- Provide data-driven insights for mental health interventions

## 📁 Dataset
**Source:** [Depression Student Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikynahidwin/depression-student-dataset)

**Key Variables:**
- Age, Gender, Academic Pressure
- Study Hours, Sleep Duration
- Dietary Habits, Financial Stress
- Depression Status (Binary)

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Missing value handling (mean/median imputation)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Variable encoding and conversion

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations:** Bar charts, histograms, box plots, pie charts
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics and frequency distributions
- **Distribution Analysis:** Normal distribution of academic pressure

### 3. Statistical Modeling
- **Logistic Regression:** Depression prediction based on Age and Study Hours
- **Linear Regression:** Study hours prediction with confidence intervals
- **Scatter Plots:** Relationship analysis between variables

## 📈 Key Findings

✅ **Gender Distribution:** Balanced representation (50% male, 50% female)  
✅ **Depression Prevalence:** Significant proportion of students affected  
✅ **Sleep Impact:** Minimal correlation with depression status  
✅ **Age Factor:** No strong linear relationship with depression  
✅ **Study Hours:** Limited direct correlation with depression levels

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Language:** R Programming
- **Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, summarytools
- **Techniques:** Regression analysis, EDA, data visualization
